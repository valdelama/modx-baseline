This is a Modx baseline package, so basically what I use to get started with on my projects. If anybody is offended by me repackaging any of their code here then please let me know and I will remove it.

##Cheatsheet
Probably the most useful part and what I will be adding to most is found at includes/cheatsheet.html It's basically a collection of commonly used code snippets. Like sample wayfinder and getresource calls.
